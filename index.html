            <ul class="list">
                <li>Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was born in <strong>1897</strong> in a village called <strong>Ngenda</strong>, which lay in an area of sugar cane and cattle pasture.</li>
                <li>His father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They were <em>shamba folk</em>, living in a homestead built on a spur of land near the <strong>River Thiririka</strong>.</li>
                <li>Muigai(Kenyatta's father) was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each of whom lived in a separate <em>nyom ba</em> (woman's hut).</li>
                <li>Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock.</li>
                <li>When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.</li>
                <li>Wambui(Kenyatta's mother) subsequently bore another son, Kongo, but Muigai died shortly after.</li>
                <li>In keeping with Kikuyu tradition, Wambui was then married to her late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta was then given the name of Kamau wa Ngengi ("Kamau, son of Ngengi").</li>
                <li>Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai.</li>
                <li>Ngengi(Kenyatta's step-dad) was harsh and resentful toward these three boys, with Wambui deciding to take her youngest son with her to stay with her parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger Muigai—travelled through the forest to collect his infant half-brother.</li>
                <li>Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a medicine man.</li>
                <li><strong>1909</strong> - Kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based there that he wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission.</li>
                <li>While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the Bible, and was taught to read and write in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing the dishes and weeding the gardens.</li>
                <li>His brother kongo later joined Kenyatta at the missionary domitory.</li>
                <li>Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in which most of the British missionaries treated them.</li>
